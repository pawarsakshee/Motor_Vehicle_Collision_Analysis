**Title:** Designing Advanced Data Architectures for Business Intelligence - Motor Vehicle Collisions/Crashes Analysis

**Introduction:** 
This project aims to design and implement advanced data architectures for analyzing motor vehicle collisions and crashes data from three major cities: New York, Chicago, and Austin. The data will be obtained from the respective Department of Transportation portals of each city. The project will involve data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), dimensional modeling, and visualization using tools like Alteryx, Talend, Azure SQL Server/MySQL/SQL Server, Tableau, and Power BI.

### **Motor Vehicle Collisions/Crashes Analysis**  

## 📌 **Introduction**  
Motor vehicle collisions pose a significant challenge in urban planning and public safety. This project aims to design and implement **advanced data architectures** for analyzing **motor vehicle collisions** across three major cities: **New York, Chicago, and Austin**.  

Using powerful **ETL processes, dimensional modeling, and data visualization**, we transform raw crash data into **actionable insights** that help identify patterns, high-risk areas, and accident trends.  

## 🔍 **Project Scope**  

### **📊 Data Sources**  
The data is sourced from the official **Department of Transportation portals**:  
- 🏙️ **New York**: [Motor Vehicle Collisions - NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us)  
- 🏙️ **Austin**: [Austin Crash Report Data - City of Austin](https://data.austintexas.gov)  
- 🏙️ **Chicago**: [Traffic Crashes - City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org)  

### **🎯 Key Objectives**  
✔️ **Determine the total number of accidents** per city.  
✔️ **Visualize** accident data using **interactive dashboards**.  
✔️ Identify **high-risk areas** with the most collisions.  
✔️ Analyze **injury-related accidents** and **pedestrian involvement**.  
✔️ Detect **seasonal patterns** and **peak accident hours**.  
✔️ Investigate **factors contributing to collisions**.  
✔️ Identify areas with **high fatality rates**.  


## 🚀 **Project Execution & Timeline**  

### **🛠️ Part 1: Data Preparation & ETL**  
- 📌 **Data Profiling** using **Alteryx/YData Profile**.  
- 📌 **Data Staging** (Creating staging tables).  
- 📌 **ETL Pipeline** development using **Talend**.  
- 📌 **Dimensional Modeling** (Fact & Dimension tables).  
- 📌 **Ensuring standardization** and best practices.  

### **📂 Part 2: Data Integration & Validation**  
- 🔎 **Load transformed data** into integration tables.  
- 🔎 **Validate dimensional model** and ensure data accuracy.  
- 🔎 **Query dimensional model** for business insights.  

### **📊 Part 3: Visualization & Reporting**  
- 📊 **Dashboard creation** in **Tableau & Power BI**.  
- 📊 **Publish reports** (if required).  
- 📊 **Submission of all ETL scripts, dashboards, and documentation**.  


## 📦 **Project Deliverables**  
✔️ **Data Profiling Reports** 📜
